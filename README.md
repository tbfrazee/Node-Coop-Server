# Babysitting Coop Server

**This project is a work in progress.**

## Design

A web app designed to help small-scale babysitting coops share personal information with other members, track hours, and coordinate babysitting requests and offers.

## Features

* Designed to be used in conjunction with a Facebook group, uses Facebook login so no separate registration is required. Users must be a member of the coop's Facebook group to access the site.

* Site hosts all pertinent information for a babysitter, including information about member households, child allergies and behaviors, routines, and contact information.

* Request and offer system to help get babysits done. Prompts to post to FB group so those who primarily use FB for coop business don't miss a request.

* Automatic hour credits and deductions.

* Arbitration system for disagreements over hours - if both requester and babysitter don't agree, both get a chance to correct before it is submitted to admin for correction.
